# Global-Energy-Trade-Analysis

Renewable energy nowadays is one of the most important fields regarding energy production. As we all know the importance of this type of energy for the environment and future generations is extremely valuable. Hence, we decide to do a small analysis on the wind, solar and nuclear energy production on a small group of selected countries. As we know nuclear energy is not renewable source but we use it here to compare the production to the wind and solar energy production.
